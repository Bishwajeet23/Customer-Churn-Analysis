# Customer-Churn-Analysis (1st project)
Use a telecom dataset to predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage, service complaints and other features. This will involve handling imbalanced data and feature engineering.

# Rainfall Prediction (2nd Project)
Rainfall Prediction is one of the difficult and uncertain tasks that have a significant impact on human society. 
Timely and accurate forecasting can proactively help reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.
